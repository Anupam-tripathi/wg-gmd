Goal: Identify how effective the community is at merging new code into the codebase.

Metric | Question
--- | ---
[Code Commits](activity-metrics/code-commits.md) | What is the number of code commits?
[Lines of Code Changed](activity-metrics/lines-of-code-changed.md) | What is the number of lines of code changed?
[Code Reviews](activity-metrics/code-reviews.md) | What is the number of code reviews?
[Code Merge Duration](activity-metrics/code-merge-duration.md) | What is the duration of time between code merge request and code commit?
[Code Review Efficiency](activity-metrics/code-review-efficiency.md) | What is the number of merged code changes/number of abandoned code change requests?
[Maintainer Response to Merge Request Duration](activity-metrics/maintainer-response-to-merge-request-duration.md) | What is the duration of time for a maintainer to make a first response to a code merge request?

[Pull Request Comment Duration](activity-metrics/pull-requests-comment-duration.md) | The difference between the timestamp of the pull request creation date and the most recent comment on the pull request.
[Pull Request Comment Diversity](activity-metrics/pull-requests-comment-diversity.md) | Number of each people discussing each pull request.
[Pull Request Comments](activity-metrics/pull-request-comments.md) | Number of comments on each pull request.

**Disclaimer:**
The name/question pairs listed are not meant to represent a fully comprehensive list. It is expected that this list will evolve as people have insights and thoughts about the name/question pairs that comprise Growth-Maturity-Decline.

**Tooling:**
The name/question pairs are intended to be a starting point for CHAOSS-related software. It is expected that this list will evolve based on the ability (or inability) of software to successfully implement the specific name/question pairs.

**Background:**
The name/question pairs have been identified based CHAOSS-related outreach activities. We thank everyone who participated.
